| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Profile** | Selects the currently active profile (a group of text sets). |
| **Texts** | Opens the "Text Editor Modal" to create, edit, and delete texts. |
| **JSON** | Opens the screen to directly edit, import, and export all settings in JSON format. |
| **Options** | **Settings for text insertion behavior** |
| `Insert newline before text` | Adds one newline character before inserting the text. |
| `Insert newline after text` | Adds one newline character after inserting the text. |
| `Insertion position` | Selects the text insertion position from "Start of the input field," "Current cursor position," or "End of the input field." |

**Note:** The behavior of `Options` settings may not work as expected depending on the state of the input field (e.g., focus state, existing content).
For the most consistent results, it is recommended to turn off the 'Insert newline' options and set the 'Insertion position' to `End`.
